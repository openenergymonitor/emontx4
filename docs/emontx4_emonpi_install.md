# Adding an emonTx4 to an existing installation

![emontx4_emonpi.jpg](img/emontx4_emonpi.jpg)

There are two ways to add an emonTx4 to an existing emonPi or emonBase installation:

1. Direct USB data connection
2. 433MHz radio data connection

---

## Direct USB data connection

The emonTx4 can be connected to an existing emonPi via a USB-C to USB-A cable (as shown in the example picture above), measurement data can be transferred over USB. This provides a simple and reliable setup.

**Tip:** For a lower cost single-phase configuration the emonTx4 can be powered from the emonPi over the same USB connection. The emonTx4 can then use the emonVs-mini pictured above (voltage sensor only) rather than the full emonVs-psu (voltage sensor with integrated power supply).

**Configuration**<br>The main thing we need to do here is tell a piece of software on the emonPi called emonHub to read from the USB serial port. 

1. Login to your local emonPi Emoncms account and navigate to Setup > EmonHub > Edit Config.

2. Under the `[interfacers]` section add the following interfacer config:

```
[[USB]]
    Type = EmonHubOEMInterfacer
    [[[init_settings]]]
        com_port = /dev/ttyUSB0
        com_baud = 115200
    [[[runtimesettings]]]
        pubchannels = ToEmonCMS,
        nodename = emonTx4
```

*If you have a relative new emonSD image, this interfacer configuration will already be populated*.

With that in place you should now see the emonTx4 inputs appear in your Emoncms inputs list.

**It is advisable to make sure that you are running the latest version of the emonHub software** as it has a couple of improvements to make sure that the USB serial connection recovers automatically after a failure such as unplugging and plugging back in the USB cable.

**If you have multiple USB ports in use** there is a risk that a device on /dev/ttyUSB0 might swap around with another on /dev/ttyUSB1. It's possible to reference the serial port by-id for a more robust solution:

    ls /dev/serial/by-id/*
    
example response:

    /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Silicon_Labs_CP2102N_USB_to_UART_Bridge_Controller_589399f65987ec118b30e33719c2d21c-if00-port0

Modify the emonhub.conf entry with the full path e.g:

    [[[init_settings]]]
        com_port = /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Silicon_Labs_CP2102N_USB_to_UART_Bridge_Controller_589399f65987ec118b30e33719c2d21c-if00-port0

## 433MHz radio data connection

Data can be transferred between the emonTx4 and emonPi via 433MHz radio. 

**A key thing to watch out for here** is that the default radio packet format for the latest emonTx4 is based on the **LowPowerLabs RFM69** code which is **not compatible** with an emonPi running the original JeeLib 'classic' code.

It is however easy to **change a new emonTx4 to transmit using the original JeeLib classic format** so that compatibility is maintained.

Alternatively it is possible up upgrade the firmware on an existing emonPi system to use the LowPowerLabs RFM69 radio format which offers hardware encryption and a packet acknowledgment/retry mechanism to minimize packet loss. LowPowerLabs firmware is also available for existing emonBase systems. Both are upgradable via the local Emoncms > Admin > Firmware update tool.

### 1. Shop option at time of purchase

It's possible to select the firmware version in the shop when buying an emonTx4:

![firmware_selection_shop.png](img/firmware_selection_shop.png)

**Standard:** LowPowerLabs radio format. **Existing hardware compatibility:** JeeLib classic format.

**Continue to EmonHub Configuration below.**

### 2. Using an emonPi to update/change the emonTx4 firmware

The easiest way of updating or changing the emonTx4 firmware is to connect it to an emonPi or emonBase with a USB cable and then use the firmware upload tool available at Setup > Admin > Update > Firmware.

**Select** the emonTx4 USB port, usually **ttyUSB0**. Select **emonTx4** hardware and then for existing hardware compatibility, select **RFM69 JeeLib Classic** in the Radio format drop down. Click Update Firmware to upload.

![emonpi_firmware_change_classic.png](img/emonpi_firmware_change_classic.png)

**Continue to EmonHub Configuration below.**

### 3. Manual firmware compile and upload

It is also possible to compile and upload the firmware with the radio format option set as desired, manually.

Start by following the [EmonTx4: How to compile and upload firmware](firmware.md) guide on the Firmware page.

At the top of the EmonTx4 firmware you will see the option to define the RadioFormat:

```
// 2. Set radio format
// Options: RFM69_JEELIB_CLASSIC, RFM69_JEELIB_NATIVE, RFM69_LOW_POWER_LABS
#define RFM69_LOW_POWER_LABS
```

For existing system compatibility change to:

    #define RFM69_JEELIB_CLASSIC

**Continue to EmonHub Configuration:**

## EmonHub Configuration

To receive the emonTx4 data on your existing emonPi/emonBase there is one last step and that is to add a node decoder configuration to emonhub. 

On your emonPi/emonBase navigate to Setup > EmonHub > Edit Config. Scroll down to the bottom of the config file and add the following emonTx4 configuration:

```
[[17]]
    nodename = emonTx4_17
    [[[rx]]]
        names = MSG, Vrms, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, E1, E2, E3, E4, E5, E6, T1, T2, T3, pulse
        datacodes = L, h, h, h, h, h, h, h, l, l, l, l, l, l, h, h, h, L
        scales = 1.0, 0.01, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 1.0
        units = n, V, W, W, W, W, W, W, Wh, Wh, Wh, Wh, Wh, Wh, C, C, C, p
```

Alternatively if you have an up-to-date emonhub installation you can try our new  `autoconf` feature. Add `autoconf = 1` just under the `[hub]` heading at the top. E.g:

```
[hub]
    loglevel = DEBUG
    autoconf = 1
```

The emonTx4 node should now automatically be detected and appear in the emoncms inputs list.
